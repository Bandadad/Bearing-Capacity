# Configuration file for computing bearing capacity and settlement for shallow foundations

# Settlement is estimated from the following equation:

# Settlement:           ΔH = 𝑞 ⋅ B'⋅ (1-ν²)/Es ⋅ m ⋅ 𝐼𝑠 ⋅ 𝐼𝑓

# ΔH: Immediate settlement
# 𝑞:  Intensity of contact pressure in units of Es
# B': Least lateral dimension of contributing base area in units of ΔH
# 𝐼𝑠: Influence factor, which depends on L'/B', thickness of stratum H, Poisson's ratio ν
# 𝐼𝑓: Influence factor, which depends on embedment depth D
# Es: Elastic settlement modulus
# ν:  Poisson's ratio  
# m:  Number of contributing base areas

# Specify the embedment depth and shape parameters:
settlement_parameters:
  D: 2.3                        # Foundation depth in meters
  shape: 1                      # L / B ratio to account for footing shape
  settlement_location: center   # Options: center, edge, corner

# Specify the backfill and foundation parameters:
soil_properties:
  gamma_backfill: 19.5     # Unit weight of structural backfill in kN/m³
  gamma_soil: 19.0         # Unit weight of the foundation soil in kN/m³
  Z: 30                    # Depth to hard layer in meters
  phi: 20                  # Soil friction angle in degrees
  c: 0                     # Soil cohesion in kPa
  nu: 0.25                 # Poisson's ratio

# If you want to read in a file with layer information, set modulus_file=True.
# csv file format should contain a row for each layer and have columns named "layer_number", "top", "bottom", "modulus"
# The first layer "top" is at the base of the foundation.
# If modulus_file=False, the constant Es value will be used.
modulus_options:
  modulus_file: True                # Set to True to read layer information from a file
  file: 'layers_metric.csv'         # Path to CSV file containing layer information
  Es: None                          # Constant Settlement Modulus in kPa (used if modulus_file is false)

# plot_options controls the x and y axis of the design chart.
plot_options:
  max_footing_width: 20             # Maximum foundation width for plotting in meters
  max_bearing_pressure: 600         # Units of Es
  X_ticks: 4                        # Major tick interval on x-axis
  Y_ticks: 50                       # Major tick interval on y-axis
